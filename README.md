#EngrProjects
This repository contains a collection of engineering projects I have completed, including a car seat designed to save a child from hypothermia in the event of being forgotten in the backseat of a hot car and an iPhone application that reminds a user to silence their cellphone when entering within a boundary set by a bluetooth beacon.
